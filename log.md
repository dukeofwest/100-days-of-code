# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the layout of a landing page. Forked 100DaysOfCode Github repo.

**Thoughts:** Creating the page's layout without a framework was quite interesting. Trying to get a hang of CSS flexbox was a challenge.

### Day 2: May 4th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Could not fix the CSS flexbox. I tried to understand CSS flexbox in great detail

**Thoughts**: I do not understand why my code is not working even after debugging and all. I hope i can get it fixed tomorrow. The goal is to complete easier projects in due time.

### Day 2: May 5th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Began learning more about CSS flexbox. I also used flexbox zombies for more inspiration.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox seems a bit still complicated for me. Playing the game flexbox zombies has helped me understand the concept more. Lets see what tomorrow holds.

### Day 2: May 6th, 2019 (Example 2)
**Today's Progress**: More CSS flexbox on my landing page. So far, 12 tests have passed out of 16.

**Thoughts**: I've used CSS flexbox in several sections on my page. I do feel my CSS file is too cluttered. I hope to do some optimizations tomorrow as well as finish the project.
