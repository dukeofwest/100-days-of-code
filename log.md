# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 03, 2019 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Completed the layout of a landing page

**Thoughts:** Creating the page's layout without a framework was quite interesting. Trying to get a hang of CSS flexbox was a challenge.

### Day 2: May 4th, 2018 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Could not fix the CSS flexbox. I tried to understand CSS flexbox in great detail

**Thoughts**: I do not understand why my code is not working even after debugging and all. I hope i can get it fixed tomorrow. The goal is to complete easier projects in due time.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
